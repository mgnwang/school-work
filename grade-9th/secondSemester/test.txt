Recipe: Tacos - 5 servings
5 stars - This is my mom's recipe that I grew up with.  She used to make her own tortillas on a griddle at the table, and serve the filling with a variety of toppings.  I'd become so eager that I'd always overfill my tortilla and end up with taco salad.  Ha! You can use store-bought corn tortillas (crisp or soft) instead.

Ingredients:
flour (1.5 cup)
cornmeal (0.75  cup)
salt (0.25 tsp)
ground beef (1.5 lb)
kidney or pinto beans (1 can)
chili powder (0.5 tsp)
tomato juice or V8 (1.5 cup)
diced green chilies (1 can)
shredded lettuce (1 cup)
chopped tomatoes (2)
salsa (1 jar)
shredded cheddar cheese (1 cup)
sour cream (1/2 cup)
avocado (2)
diced jalapeno (1)
diced green chilies (1 can)
chopped olives (1/2 can)

Directions:
Tortillas: Mix first three ingredients and cook on a griddle like pancakes, using the back of a wooden spoon to thin them.  
Meat Filling: Brown the ground beef, and drain fat.  Add to the pan the beans, chili powder, tomato juice, and green chilies, and simmer.  Serve with tortillas and other toppings including lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, cheese, sour cream, avocado, jalapenos, green chilies, and olives.
